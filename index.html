                        <p> I am a software developer with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Drexel University. During my studies I did an internship at a company called proServices in Tenton, NJ. At the time they tested code for bugs, for other companies. I worked on a network component using .NET C# and Windows Communication Foundation. I also worked for them prior to graduation for a couple of months, which involved exploring the use of NHibernate as an alternative to ADO.NET. for database storage and access. Prior to graduate school I worked for a small third party eBay business for which I built and maintained the company website. The main functionality of the website was for customers to access their accounts to track the status of items that the company was selling on their behalf. I used .NET C# and MVC for this website and Microsoft SQL Server. After graduation I worked for PrimePay, a company which did taxes and other services for small businesses. I developed code that moved data from the database and populated electronic tax files and electronic tax forms. After a brief hiatus from development I took the UPenn LPS Bootcamp to refresh my web development skills and to learn the MERN stack.</p>
